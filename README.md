# wahlomat-extended-analysis
This is an extension of the analysis by Reddit user /u/microraptor/ of the questionaires from www.wahl-o-mat.de. 
Check out [his repo](https://github.com/microraptor/wahlomat_analysis) for the original analysis.
His analysis in return have been inspired by Reddit users /u/d_loose/ and /u/askLubich/.
The analysis script generates a correlation matrix and a principal component analysis map, where also clusters are marked.

The analysis is extended in the sense that it is run for available wahl-o-mat questionnaires. 
Further explanations of the extensions to the original analysis are documented in the section __Changes__

## Analysis steps

1. Run the file get_zip_files.py to download all zip-files containing the questionaires from the website www.wahl-o-mat.de and unzip them in new folder named "data".
2. Run the file load_modules.py to run the analysis function from analysis.py for all downloaded modules. The graphs generated by the analysis are placed in a newly created folder named "graphs". If a folder with the same name exists already, then the graphs will be placed there. 

The default settings used by the analysis function don't work for all questionnaires, mostly due to lack of parties which participated in the questionnaires.
Therefore, you can run the file failed_analysis.py to get the data for these elections placed into new dataframes.
__NB__: The list used in this script is based on my own previous analysis and creates global variables/dataframes with names based on the election for easier analysis.

## What is the wahl-o-mat?
According to [the website](https://www.bpb.de/themen/wahl-o-mat/294576/wie-funktioniert-der-wahl-o-mat/) (in German) the
> Wahl-O-Mat is a question-and-answer tool that shows which party admitted to an election is closest to one's own political position.


## Explanation of the results

For an overview of how to interpret the analysis check out [askLubich's repo](https://github.com/askLubich/Wahl-O-Mat-EU-2019) 
or his [German explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/bqubdv/wahlomat_analyse_zur_euparlamentswahl_2019_oc/eo7zmaq/).

## Changes
- Added get_zip_files.py to download all questionnaires
- Added load_modules.py and deal with elections who have their modules.js file encoded with latin1 instead utf8.
- Minor changes to the regular expressions used to read the data from the file modules.js to deal with some inconsistencies across elections 
- Added build_dataframe.py, a WIP file to create one dataframe containing the data from all elections.


## Dependencies for Local Execution
See [requirement.txt](requirement.txt).
This script requires to have Python 3.8+.
The dependencies are the same as for microraptor's analysis.
